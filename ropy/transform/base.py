    The function creates a N-dimensional rotation matrix that rotates a point by
    a set angle inside an oriented plane. The plane is defined by the two basis
    vectors u and v and the (positive) direction of rotation is from u to v.

    For example, if ``u=(1,0,0,1)`` (the x-axis) and ``v=(0,1,0,1)`` (the
    y-axis) then the resulting matrix rotates vectors counter-clockwise around
    the z-axis, i.e., it rotates vectors in the x-y plane.

    Parameters
    ----------
    angle : float
        The amount (in radians) by which to rotate the plane.
    u : np.array
        The first basis vectors (u,v) spanning the plane of
        rotation. The vector is given in homogeneous coordinates.
    v : np.array
        The second basis vectors (u,v) that span the plane of rotation. The
        vector is given in homogeneous coordinates.

    Returns
    -------
    rotation_matrix : np.array
        A matrix representing the rotation in homogeneous coordinates.

    Notes
    -----
    If u and v are not orthonormal, the resulting matrix is no longer a pure
    rotation.
